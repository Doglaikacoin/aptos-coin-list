# How to add to this coin list

1. fork repo
2. add `TOKEN_ICON.svg` (no larger than 100x100) to `icons` folder
3. add `RawCoinInfo` to [requestList.ts](https://github.com/hippospace/aptos-coin-list/blob/main/typescript/src/requestList.ts)
4. PR
5. Shout in [TG](https://t.me/+LBfzjYgGlVdjN2Y1)

Once PR is accepted, any [authorized maintainer](https://github.com/hippospace/aptos-coin-list/blob/main/sources/coin_list.move#L37)
will be able to add the RawCoinInfo to our on-chain list by running `yarn admin-cli -c config.yaml approve-symbol SYMBOL`.

# Fetching list
You can use the [client](https://github.com/hippospace/aptos-coin-list/blob/2663369014b2035654bf4778e3794ecbf0b0fc06/typescript/src/client.ts#L51) 
provided in the included typescript sdk to fetch an updated list from the chain, or you could fetch the json file 
from github which is frequently updated:
- [testnet list](https://github.com/hippospace/aptos-coin-list/blob/main/typescript/src/defaultList.testnet.json)
- [mainnet list](https://github.com/hippospace/aptos-coin-list/blob/main/typescript/src/defaultList.mainnet.json)

# Displaying RawCoinInfo
We recommend frontends display the following information for each coin:
- `name`: full coin name, usually includes project name
- `symbol` or `official_symbol`: short 3-6 letter representation
- `logo_url`: coin logo

The reason we have both `symbol` field and `official_symbol` is that the `symbol` field is required to be unique within
this registry, whereas for `official_symbol` there is no such requirement. For example, different bridge protocols may
have their own bridged versions of `USDC`. They are allowed to use `USDC` as the `official_symbol`, but are required to
use distinct `symbol`s (e.g. `xUSDC`, `yUSDC`).

In a complete `RawCoinInfo`, we have these fields:
- `name`: coin name, preferrably include project name
- `symbol`: globally unique symbol within this coin registry
- `official_symbol`: same as `aptos_framework::coin::CoinInfo.symbol`, duplicates allowed
- `coingecko_id`: coingecko id. May be used by various clients to look up coin price
- `logo_url`: URL to token logo, preferrably a githubusercontent url
- `project_url`: URL to project
- `token_type`: token address info
- `extensions`: other informal info that you want to add, in the form of a list of string-string key-value pairs

Example:

```typescript
{
  "name": "Aptos Coin",
  "symbol": "APT",
  "official_symbol": "APT",
  "coingecko_id": "aptos",
  "decimals": 8,
  "logo_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hippospace/aptos-coin-list/main/icons/APT.webp",
  "project_url": "https://aptoslabs.com/",
  "token_type": {
    "type": "0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin",
    "account_address": "0x1",
    "module_name": "aptos_coin",
    "struct_name": "AptosCoin"
  },
  "extensions": {
    "data": []
  }
},
```

# Use the CoinList TS SDK

npm repo: `@manahippo/coin-list`

Client interface: [here](https://github.com/hippospace/aptos-coin-list/blob/2663369014b2035654bf4778e3794ecbf0b0fc06/typescript/src/client.ts#L51)

Note that this npm repo contains a default list that's that's auto-generated by running 
```bash
yarn cli -c config.yaml coin-list:query-fetch-full-list 0xb5d6dbc225e8c42cec66664ebbccaef2098107f699510613a0b90214f659bb46
```

The default list can be found [here](https://github.com/hippospace/aptos-coin-list/blob/main/typescript/src/list.ts#L23).

# token-list

A permissionless, on-chain token list for aptos.

This coin list adopts a model where listing is separated into a 2-step process:
1. Coin owner (owner of coin's module) registers CoinInfo into CoinRegistry
2. CoinList users create their own list, and indicate which coins they'd like to add to their own list

The primary structs are:
- `CoinInfo`: contains information about a particular coin, including items such as symbol, logo-url, project-url,
  coingecko-id, and a set of owner-defined extensions in the form of `SimpleMap<String, String>`.
- `CoinRegistry`: there is a single `CoinRegistry` globally that contains all registered CoinInfo. Only module owner of
  coin type is allowed to edit its own information in the registry. (admins can also edit)
- `CoinList`: each user can own a `CoinList`, which contains a subset of keys that the user is interested in.

CoinInfo is maintained exclusively in the CoinRegistry, and each user's CoinList only contains the set of included coin
TypeInfo. This allows CoinInfo to be registered permissionlessly, yet each user still has control over which subset of
all registered coins he wants to include into his own list.

Each user's full CoinList can be fetched in a single lookup using `move-to-ts`'s query feature
```typescript
const {client, account} = ...;
const app = new App(client).coin_list.coin_list;
const myList = await app.query_fetch_full_list(account, account.address(), []);
```

A major difference this design has with `aptos_framework::coin::CoinInfo` is that our `CoinInfo` do not have type
parameters, and are therefore not stored as independent resources. This allows us to iterate over a set of CoinInfo
values (not possible if they are type-parameterized).

}
```

Or you can fetch the all registered CoinInfo using:
```bash
yarn cli -c APTOS_CONFIG_FILE coin-list:query-fetch-all-registered-coin-info
```

This would return more result than the previous command.
